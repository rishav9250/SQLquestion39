 What is the need for a MERGE statement?


The MERGE command in SQL is actually a combination of three SQL statements: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. In simple words, the MERGE statement in SQL provides a convenient way to perform all these three operations together which can be very helpful when it comes to handling large running databases. But unlike INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements MERGE statement requires a source table to perform these operations on the required table which is called a target table. For more details please read the SQL | MERGE Statement article.
